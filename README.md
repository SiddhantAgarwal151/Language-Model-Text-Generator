# Text Generation using LSTM-based Language Model

This project demonstrates text generation using an LSTM-based language model. The goal is to explore language processing and creativity in generating text using TensorFlow and Python.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- pandas

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running: `pip install tensorflow numpy pandas`
3. Prepare your data:
   - Create a text file named `test.txt` containing the input data (plot summaries, in this case) separated by tabs.
4. Run the provided Python script `text_generation.py`.

## Project Explanation

The provided `text_generation.py` script is divided into several steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The script reads the data from `test.txt` and preprocesses it by cleaning the text, converting it to lowercase, and removing extra whitespace.

2. **Tokenization and Vocabulary Building**: The data is tokenized into sequences, and a vocabulary is constructed using TensorFlow's Tokenizer. The maximum number of words in the vocabulary is set to 10,000.

3. **Sequencing the Data**: Tokenized sequences are padded to the same length to ensure uniform input dimensions for the LSTM model.

4. **Creating Input and Output Sequences**: The input sequences and corresponding output labels are created. Output labels are one-hot encoded.

5. **Model Architecture**: An LSTM-based Sequential model is built using TensorFlow. It includes an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a dense output layer with a softmax activation function.

6. **Model Training**: The model is compiled and trained on the input sequences and output labels for 50 epochs.

7. **Text Generation**: The trained model is used to generate text given a seed text. The `temperature` parameter controls the randomness of the generated text.

## Results

The generated text will be displayed in the console after running the script. The output demonstrates how the LSTM-based model learns patterns and generates coherent text based on those patterns.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the potential of LSTM-based models in simulating cognitive processes related to language comprehension and creativity. By generating text, we gain insights into language processing and creative text generation. The code offers a practical example of how cognitive science concepts can be implemented in the field of natural language processing.
